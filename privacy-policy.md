**Effective Date:** 2025-05-19

Welcome to Interview Proctor (the "Add-on"), a Google Meet add-on provided by AI Proctor ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your personal information with transparency and care. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how we collect, use, store, share, and protect your information in connection with your use of our Add-on.

This Policy should be read in conjunction with our Terms of Service, available at https://binp.github.io/aiproctor/terms-of-service.md. By installing, accessing, or using the Add-on, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, do not install or use the Add-on.

**1. Information We Collect**

We collect information to provide and improve our Add-on. The types of information we collect depend on how you use the Add-on, specifically whether you are using it in "Host Mode" or "Guest Mode."

**A. Information Collected from Hosts (When Using "Host Mode")**

When a user ("Host") utilizes the "Host Mode" features of the Add-on, and with the Host's explicit action or configuration, the Add-on is designed to collect the following types of information from the Host's device during an active Google Meet session where the Add-on is enabled:

* **Screenshots:** Still images (screenshots) of the Google Meet interface or specific application windows on the Host's computer, as designated and initiated by the Host. This may inadvertently include images or information of meeting participants ("Guests") if they are visible on the Host's screen at the time of capture.
* **Information on Running Processes:** A list or details of software applications and processes running on the Host's machine at the time of collection.
* **Information on Open Chrome Tabs:** Titles and/or URLs of browser tabs open in the Host's Google Chrome browser at the time of collection.

**Purpose of Collection (Host Mode Data):**
The information collected in Host Mode is solely for the use of the Host. The intended purposes are:
* To aid in interview documentation and record-keeping for the Host.
* To provide contextual information to the Host during technical interviews or other meeting scenarios.
* To allow the Host to review specific aspects of the interview or meeting session for their assessment or recall purposes.

**B. Information Collected from Guests**

The Add-on, when used by a Guest (a meeting participant other than the Host), **does not directly collect screenshots, information on running processes, or information on open Chrome tabs from the Guest's device.**

However, Guests should be aware that if a Host uses the Add-on's screenshot feature, images or information of Guests (such as their video feed, shared screen content, or chat messages visible on the Host's screen) may be captured as part of the screenshot taken by the Host. **The Host is solely responsible for informing Guests and obtaining any necessary consents for such collection, as outlined in our Terms of Service.**

**C. Information We Collect Automatically (All Users)**

When you use the Add-on, we may collect limited technical information automatically, such as:
* **Usage Data:** Information about how you interact with the Add-on, such as features used, frequency of use, error logs, and performance data. This data is typically aggregated and anonymized.

    * **Host Data:** The retention period for Host Data (screenshots, process information, tab information) is determined by the Host through their use of the Add-on or by our stated data retention policies for the service tier they are on. [**Specify default retention or how Hosts manage this. E.g., "Hosts can delete their collected data at any time through the Add-on interface." or "Data is retained for X period unless deleted by the Host or their subscription ends."**]
    * Usage data and technical information may be retained for longer periods for analytical purposes, typically in an aggregated or anonymized form.
