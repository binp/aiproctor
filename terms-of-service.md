**Terms of Service for Interview Proctor**

**Effective Date:** 2025-05-19

Welcome to Interview Proctor (the "Add-on"), a Google Meet add-on provided by AI Proctor ("we," "us," or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our Add-on. By installing, accessing, or using the Add-on, you ("User," "you," or "your") agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not install or use the Add-on.

**1. Description of the Service**

Interview Proctor is a Google Meet add-on designed to assist interview hosts by providing tools to document and assess interview sessions conducted via Google Meet.

**Key Features and Data Collection (Host Mode):**
When used in "Host Mode" by an authorized user (the "Host"), and with the Host's explicit action or configuration, the Add-on has the capability to:
* **Collect Screenshots:** Capture screenshots of the meeting interface or specific windows as designated by the Host during a Google Meet session.
* **Collect Information on Running Processes:** Gather information about software processes running on the Host's machine during the Google Meet session where the Add-on is active.
* **Collect Information on Open Chrome Tabs:** Identify the titles or URLs of Chrome browser tabs open on the Host's machine during the Google Meet session where the Add-on is active.

The specific and limited purpose(s) for collecting this information is/are to provide contextual information to the Host during technical interviews. This information is collected for the Host's use and is subject to the storage and security measures outlined in our Privacy Policy.

**Guest Mode:** The Add-on also offers a "Guest Mode" which allows meeting participants other than the Host ("Guests") to participate in interactive features initiated by the Host. **Guest Mode involves the collection of screenshots, running processes, or open Chrome tabs from the Guest's machine by our Add-on.**

**2. Acceptance of Terms**

By installing, clicking an "accept" or similar button or checkbox if available, or by accessing or using the Add-on, you affirm that you are of legal age to enter into these Terms, or, if you are not, that you have obtained parental or guardian consent to enter into these Terms. You also affirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Add-on on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization or entity to these Terms, and in such event, "you" and "your" will refer to that organization or entity.

**3. Privacy Policy**

Your privacy is critically important to us. Our collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal information, including the sensitive data described in Section 1, are governed by our Privacy Policy, which is available at [**Insert Link to Your Privacy Policy Here**]. You must read and agree to the Privacy Policy before using the Add-on. The Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into these Terms and forms an integral part of this agreement.

**4. User Eligibility and Responsibilities**

* You are solely responsible for your conduct while using the Add-on and for any data, text, information, graphics, photos, profiles, audio and video clips, links, and other content that you submit, post, and display via the Add-on.

* **Host's Responsibility for Consent and Lawful Use (CRUCIAL CLAUSE):**

    * **Responsibility for Participant Notice and Consent:** If you, as the Host, use the Add-on in a manner that might capture information (including images, screen content, voice, or any personally identifiable information) related to other participants (Guests) in a Google Meet session, **you are solely responsible for obtaining all necessary and legally compliant notices, consents, and authorizations from such participants BEFORE initiating any such data collection.** This includes, but is not limited to, informing them clearly and conspicuously about:
        * The fact that the Add-on is in use.
        * What specific data will be collected by your use of the Add-on (e.g., screenshots of the meeting, potentially including their image or shared screen).
        * The purpose(s) of this data collection.
        * How the data will be used, stored, and by whom it might be accessed (e.g., by you, the Host, and potentially your organization).
        * Their rights regarding their data.
    * You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless against any claims, damages, losses, or liabilities arising from your failure to obtain proper notice and consent from meeting participants or any other unlawful or unethical use of the Add-on.
    * We strongly recommend providing a clear verbal and/or written disclosure to all participants at the beginning of any meeting where such features of the Add-on will be used. You should also consider the policies of your own organization regarding monitoring and recording.

**14. Third-Party Services and Links**

The Add-on operates in conjunction with Google Meet and the Google Workspace platform, services provided by Google LLC. Your use of Google Meet and Google Workspace is subject to Google's own terms of service and privacy policies. We are not responsible or liable for Google Meet, Google Workspace, or their operations, nor for any data processed solely by Google. The Add-on may also contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by us. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services.

**15. Modifications to the Add-on and Terms**

We will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Add-on.
* **Modifications to Terms:** We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect (e.g., by posting a notice within the Add-on, on our website, or by sending an email to registered users if applicable). What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Add-on after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, in whole or in part, you must stop using the Add-on. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically for changes.

**16. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution**

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

[**Consult your lawyer to determine the most appropriate dispute resolution mechanism. Options include:**]

* **Option 1: Arbitration (Example Language - MUST BE REVIEWED BY COUNSEL):**
    "Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in [City, State of Arbitration] before one (1) arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by [e.g., JAMS (Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services) or American Arbitration Association (AAA)] pursuant to its [e.g., JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures or AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules]. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction."
    **"YOU AND AI PROCTOR AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding."** (Ensure class action waiver language is permissible in your jurisdiction).

* **Option 2: Exclusive Jurisdiction for Courts (Example Language - MUST BE REVIEWED BY COUNSEL):**
    "You agree that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Add-on shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in [County, State of Jurisdiction], and you hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum."

**17. Entire Agreement**

These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any other legal notices or terms published by us concerning the Add-on (including, but not limited to, terms on our pricing page or within the Google Workspace Marketplace listing), constitute the entire agreement between you and [Your Company Name/Your Name] concerning your use of the Add-on and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter.

**18. Severability**

If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, such provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, or if modification is not possible, it shall be severed from these Terms, and the remaining provisions of the Terms shall continue in full force and effect.

**19. Waiver**

No waiver by [Your Company Name/Your Name] of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of [Your Company Name/Your Name] to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

**20. Assignment**

You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. We may assign or transfer these Terms, at our sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.

**21. Notices**

Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be in writing and given by us (i) via email (to the address that you provide if you have registered an account or purchased a subscription); (ii) by posting to our website; or (iii) by posting a notice within the Add-on interface. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted. For notices provided by posting, the date of posting will be deemed the date of notice.

**22. Force Majeure**

We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic, or communications failure or degradation, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, pandemics, epidemics, or strikes.
